SYNOPSIS -------------------------------------------------------------

vbindiff *file1* [ *file2* ]


DESCRIPTION ----------------------------------------------------------

Visual Binary Diff (VBinDiff) displays files in hexadecimal and ASCII
(or EBCDIC).  It can also display two files at once, and highlight the
differences between them.  Unlike diff, it works well with large files
(up to 4 GB).


Viewing files --------------------------------------------------------

Movement Keys
-------------
Up      Move one line (16 bytes) towards the beginning of the file
Down    Move one line (16 bytes) towards the end of the file
Left    Move one byte towards the beginning of the file
Right   Move one byte towards the end of the file
PageUp  Move one page towards the beginning of the file
PageDn  Move one page towards the end of the file
Home    Move to the beginning of the file
End     Move to the end of the (shorter) file
F       Search for a string or byte sequence
G       Move to a specified file position

When displaying two files, both files move together.  If bytes have
been added or removed in one of the files, you can adjust the
comparison by moving just one of the files.  Holding down Alt while
using the movement keys will scroll only the bottom file.  Holding
down Ctrl will scroll only the top file.

Other Keys
----------
Enter  Move to the next difference between the files
Space  (same as Enter)
C      Toggle between ASCII and EBCDIC display
E      Edit currently displayed section of file
Esc    Exit VBinDiff
Q      Exit VBinDiff

The "Enter" key will advance to the next difference between the files
(after those already displayed on the screen).  If there are no more
differences, it moves to the end.


Line editor ----------------------------------------------------------

The line editor is used to enter search strings and file positions.
It uses the basic Emacs-style editing keys.

Keys
-----------------
Ctrl-B, Left       Move the cursor one character left
Ctrl-F, Right      Move the cursor one character right
Ctrl-A, Home       Move to the beginning of the line
Ctrl-E, End        Move to the end of the line
Ctrl-P, Up         Move up in input history
Ctrl-N, Down       Move down in input history
Ctrl-H, Backspace  Delete the character to the left
Ctrl-D, Delete     Delete the character under the cursor
Ctrl-K             Delete from cursor to end of line
Insert             Toggle between insert & overstrike mode
Enter              Finished entering text
Esc                Abort the operation


Editing files --------------------------------------------------------

You can press "E" to edit the current file.  When displaying two
files, this edits the one in the top window.  Press "Alt+E" to edit
the file in the bottom window.

When editing, you can move the cursor around with the arrow keys.  Use
TAB to switch between entering hexadecimal or ASCII (or EBCDIC)
characters.  Press the Esc key when you are done.  You will be given
the choice to save or discard your changes then.

If you are displaying two files, you can use the Enter key to copy a
byte from the other file into the one you are editing.

You cannot scroll through the file while editing, although you can
save your changes and then move to a different part of the file.
Also, you cannot insert or delete bytes, only change them.


OPTIONS --------------------------------------------------------------

-L, --license   Display license information for vbindiff
-V, --version   Display the version number
    --help      Display help information


BUGS -----------------------------------------------------------------

Does not work properly with files over 4 gigabytes.  It should be able
to view the first 4 gigabytes ok, but the display only has room for 8
hex digits of file position, and the Goto box is also limited to 8
digits.
